ABSTRACT

Data curation is commonly the ‘cinderella’ of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies).  Commonly it receives little attention from researchers or managers and may be seen as a tedious chore to be done in wrapping up the research activity.  Since research may well be continuous, such wrapping up may not occur.
In contrast, many important research discoveries have been made by re-working old data and/or by comparison of old data with recently collected data.  This is particularly true of environmental sciences where understanding the atmospheric, biospheric, hydrospheric and geospheric processes usually requires long-term observation and subsequent analysis.
Furthermore, validation and re-validation of research results requires open and understandable access to the data used in the preparation of the original publication.
Data curation is thus an important aspect of ENVRIplus and a key element of the ICT architectural and governance design.  Data curation is integral to research workflows and processes and also integrates with all ICT activities through cataloguing and provenance.  With an evolving policy of open access to data ? as well as publications ? and, in time, software developed from the open source movement ? curation has become more visible and necessary.
This deliverable reviews the state of the art and recommends architectural principles to be taken into account (along with the inputs on other topics) in the initial and subsequent architectural design phases of ENVRIplus.

PROJECT SUMMARY 
ENVRIplus is a Horizon 2020 project bringing together Environmental and Earth System Research Infrastructures, projects and networks together with technical specialist partners to create a more coherent, interdisciplinary and interoperable cluster of Environmental Research Infrastructures across Europe. It is driven by three overarching goals: 1) promoting cross-fertilization between infrastructures, 2) implementing innovative concepts and devices across RIs, and 3) facilitating research and innovation in the field of environment for an increasing number of users outside the RIs. 
ENVRIplus aligns its activities to a core strategic plan where sharing multi-disciplinary expertise will be most effective. The project aims to improve Earth observation monitoring systems and strategies, including actions to improve harmonization and innovation, and generate common solutions to many shared information technology and data related challenges. It also seeks to harmonize policies for access and provide strategies for knowledge transfer amongst RIs. ENVRIplus develops guidelines to enhance transdisciplinary use of data and data-products supported by applied use-cases involving RIs from different domains. The project coordinates actions to improve communication and cooperation, addressing Environmental RIs at all levels, from management to end-users, implementing RI-staff exchange programs, generating material for RI personnel, and proposing common strategic developments and actions for enhancing services to users and evaluating the socio-economic impacts. 
ENVRIplus is expected to facilitate structuration and improve quality of services offered both within single RIs and at the pan-RI level. It promotes efficient and multi-disciplinary research offering new opportunities to users, new tools to RI managers and new communication strategies for environmental RI communities. The resulting solutions, services and other project outcomes are made available to all environmental RI initiatives, thus contributing to the development of a coherent European RI ecosystem.

DATA CURATION IN SYSTEM LEVEL SCIENCE: INITIAL DESIGN






INTRODUCTION

Abstract
Data curation is commonly the ‘cinderella’ of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies).  Commonly it receives little attention from researchers or managers and may be seen as a tedious chore to be done in wrapping up the research activity.  Since research may well be continuous, such wrapping up may not occur.
In contrast, many important research discoveries have been made by re-working old data and/or by comparison of old date with recently collected data.  This is particularly true of environmental sciences where understanding the atmospheric, biospheric, hydrospheric and geospheric processes usually requires long-term observation and subsequent analysis.
Furthermore, validation and re-validation of research results requires open and understandable access to the data used in the preparation of the original publication.
Data curation is thus an important aspect of ENVRIplus and a key element of the ICT architectural and governance design.  Data curation is integral to research workflows and processes and also integrates with all ICT activities through cataloguing and provenance.  With an evolving policy of open access to data ? as well as publications ? and, in time, software developed from the open source movement ? curation has become more visible and necessary.
This deliverable reviews the state of the art and recommends architectural principles to be taken into account (along with the inputs on other topics) in the initial and subsequent architectural design phases of ENVRIplus.
Method
This activity (T8.1 within WP8) was undertaken by the primary author with contributions from key staff from other partners.  The steps taken within the first 18 months of ENVRIplus are as follows:
1. Literature review on curation and review of activities in other recent and current projects;
2. Extraction of curation requirements from use cases and stated requirements particularly from the work associated with D5.1;
3. WP8 and wider discussion on the commonalities of metadata required and processes / workflows between curation and other ICT aspects particularly cataloguing and provenance but also identification and citation (WP6) and processing (WP7).
4. WP5-WP8 discussions on representation of curation in the developing ENVRI Reference Model;
5. WP9-WP8 discussions on evaluation of curation ? particularly against the use cases;
6. Initial design of metadata and processing architecture for curation
7. Initial design of governance for curation
8. 

STATE OF THE ART AND REVIEW
Introduction, context and scope
“Digital curation爄s the selection, preservation, maintenance, collection and archiving of燿igital燼ssets.燚igital curation爀stablishes, maintains and adds value to repositories of燿igital燿ata for present and future use. This is often accomplished by archivists, librarians, scientists, historians, and scholars” (Wikipedia).
It should be noted that Cataloguing, Curation and Provenance are commonly grouped together since the metadata, workflow, processes and legal issues associated with each have more than 70% intersection in requirements and therefore rather than generating independent systems a common approach is preferable.  Moreover, there are strong interdependencies with identification and citation, with AAAI, with processing, with optimisation, with modelling and with architecture.
The origins of curation stretch back to the earliest librarianship (including making copies to be distributed in monasteries and in the well-known case of the ‘Magna Carta’ in UK with distribution to cathedrals ? this finds its modern equivalent in LOCKSS1) and to the identification and cataloguing with metadata of objects of interest in museums.
A key aspect of curation is the interplay between governance and technology. Finding technological solutions to satisfy the principles of governance is not always easy.  Another key aspect is involving the researchers in the decision making of what to keep and what to discard; this provides motivation for the process of curation including the provision of appropriate metadata.
Sources of state of the art technology information used
Relevant major sources are the Data Curation Centre (DCC), Open Archival Information System (OAIS) (both discussed below) and Research Data Alliance (RDA), which has several relevant groups notably preservation2 but also active data management plans3 and reproducibility4.  Knowledge of the bibliography and of curation activities in current and recent projects provide further source material.
Short term analysis of state of the art and trends
The ideal curation state is aimed to ensure the availability of digital assets through media migration to ensure physical readability, redundant copies to ensure availability, appropriate security and privacy measures to ensure reliability and appropriate metadata to allow discovery, contextualisation and use, including information on provenance and rights.  The current practice commonly falls far short of this with preservation commonly linked with backup or recovery (usually limited to the physical preservation of the digital asset) and lacking the steps of curation (selection, ingestion, preservation, archiving [including metadata]) and maintenance.  Furthermore, in the current state while datasets may be curated it is rare for software or operational environments to be curated. Including these is necessary to achieve reusability [Belhajjame 2015]. Collecting them automatically has been demonstrated by [Santana-Perez 2016], where processes in a virtual environment are monitored and their interactions with external resources recorded. The collected information is used to automatically create a virtual image in which the job can be deployed and re-run on the cloud.  However, while this is feasible in a homogeneous environment it is a leading edge research topic to achieve this in a heterogeneous environment such as ENVRIplus.
Curation Lifecycle
The desirable lifecycle is represented by a DCC (Digital Curation Centre) diagram5 (Figure 5).

FIGURE 5: THE CURATION LIFECYCLE MODEL FROM DCC (THE DIGITAL CURATION CENTRE)

Data Management Plan
Increasingly research funders are demanding a DMP (Data Management Plan).  Different organisations have proposed different templates and tools for plans but that of DCC is used widely6 as is the US equivalent7.  A DMP is defined (Wikipedia) “A燿ata management plan爋r DMP is a formal document that outlines how you will handle your燿ata燽oth during your research, and after the project is completed”.
OAIS Reference Model
OAIS (Open Archival Information Systems Reference Model — ISO 14721:2003) provides a generic conceptual framework for building a complete archival repository, and identifies the responsibilities and interactions of Producers, Consumers and Managers of both paper and digital records. The standard defines the processes required for effective long-term preservation and access to information objects, while establishing a common language to describe these. It does not specify an implementation, but provides the framework to make a successful implementation possible, through describing the basic functionality required for a preservation archive. It identifies mandatory responsibilities, and provides standardised methods to describe a repository’s functionality by providing detailed models of archival information and archival functions [Higgins 2006].  A set of metadata elements in a structure has been proposed8.
RDA (Research Data Alliance)
The Research Data Alliance has groups working on this (see above). However, their work is brought together with that of other groups in the specification of metadata9.  RDA has proposed some metadata principles:
* The only difference between metadata and data is mode of use
* Metadata is not just for data, it is also for users, software services, computing resources
* Metadata is not just for description and discovery; it is also for contextualisation (relevance, quality, restrictions (rights, costs)) and for coupling users, software and computing resources to data (to provide a� VRE)
* Metadata must be machine-understandable as well as human understandable for autonomicity (formalism)
* Management (meta)data is also relevant (research proposal, funding, project information, research outputs, outcomes, impact�)

And furthermore  a metadata element set that covers all the uses of metadata (not just curation):
* Unique Identifier (for later use including citation)
* Location (URL)
* Description
* Keywords (terms)
* Temporal coordinates
* Spatial coordinates
* Originator (organisation(s) / person(s))
* Project
* Facility / equipment
* Quality
* Availability (licence, persistence)
* Provenance
* Citations
* Related publications (white or grey)
* Related software
* Schema
* Medium / format
It should be noted that many elements within this set have internal structure (syntax) and semantics (meaning) and so are not simple attributes with values.  The RDA groups are currently working on ‘unpacking’ the elements to a form suitable for discovery, contextualisation and action by both humans and computers. 
Problems to be Overcome
The following are some important problems that need to be addressed for curation:
1. Motivation: There is little motivation for researchers to curate their digital assets.  At present curation activity obtains no ‘reward’ such as career preferment based on data citations.  In some organisations curation of digital assets is regarded as a librarian function but without the detailed knowledge of the researcher the associated metadata is likely to be substandard. Increasingly funding agencies are demanding curation of digital assets produced by publicly funded research.
2. Business model: Curation involves deciding what assets to curate and of those, for how long they should be kept.  Determining an appropriate duration of retention for a digital asset is a problem; economics and business models do not manage well the concept of infinite time.  First a business justification is needed in that (a) the asset cannot be collected again (i.e., it is a unique observation, experiment); (b) the cost of collecting again (by the same or another researcher) is greater than the cost of curation.   
3. Metadata: Metadata collection is expensive unless it is automated or at least partially automated during the data lifecycle by re-using information already collected.  Commonly, metadata is generated separately for discovery, contextualisation, curation and provenance when much of the metadata content is shared across these functions.  A comprehensive but incrementally completed metadata element set is required that covers the required functions of the lifecycle. It needs sufficient application domain data that other specialists in that domain will be able to find and correctly interpret the associated data.
4. Process: The lifecycle of digital research entities is well understood and it needs process support.  The incremental metadata collection aspect is critically important for success.  Workflow models ? if adapted to such an incremental metadata collection with appropriate validation ?are likely to be valuable here [Jeffery 2006].
5. Curation of data: It may be considered that curation of data is straightforward ?but it is not.  First the dataset may not be static (by analogy with a type-specimen in a museum); both streamed data and updateable databases are dynamic thus leaving management decisions to be made on frequency of curation and management of versions with obvious links to provenance.  Issues related to security and privacy change with time and the various licences for data use each have different complexities.  The data may change ownership or stewardship.  Copies may be made and distributed to ensure availability but then have to be managed in systems such as LOCKSS. Derivatives may be generated and require management including relationships with the original dataset and all its attendant metadata.
6. Curation of software: Software written 50 years ago is unlikely to compile (let alone compose with software libraries and execute) today.  Indeed, many items of software, such as the workflows behind a scientific method, will either not run or give different results, six months later. Since many research propositions are based on the combination of the software (algorithm) and dataset(s) then the preservation and curation of the software becomes very important.  It is likely that in future it will be necessary to curate not only the software but also a specification of the software in a canonical representation so that the same software process or algorithm can be reconstructed (and ideally generated) from the specification.  This leaves the question of whether associated software libraries are considered part of the software to be curated or part of the operating environment (see below). Very often software contains many years-worth of intellectual investment by collaborating experts. It is not unusual for the software to encode the ‘scientific method’ used by the researcher which may be less well (or less formally) documented elsewhere (e.g. scholarly publications). This makes software very valuable and hard to replace. Taking good care of such assets will be a requirement for most research communities.
7. Curation of operational environments: It is necessary to record the operational environment of the software and dataset(s).  The hardware used ? whether instrumentation for collection or computation devices ? has characteristics relating to accuracy, precision, operational speed, capacity and many more.  The operating system has defined characteristics and includes device drivers ? i.e., a software library used by the application.  It is a moot point whether software libraries belong to the application software or to the operational environment for the purposes of curation.  Finally, the management ethos of the operational environment normally represented as policies requires curation.
A longer-term horizon
There is some cause for optimism:
1. Media costs are decreasing ? so more can be preserved for less (and the cost reduction hopefully matches the expansion of volume);
2. Awareness of the need for curation is increasing; partly through policies of funding organisations and partly through increased responsibility of some researchers;
3. Research projects in ICT are starting to produce autonomic systems that could be used to assist with curation.
However, the major problem is the cost of collecting metadata for curation. Firstly, incremental collection along the workflow with re-use of existing information should assist. Workflow systems should be evolved to accomplish this.  Secondly, improving techniques of automated metadata extraction from digital objects may reach production status in this timeframe10.
Issues and implications
1. Commonality of metadata elements across curation, provenance, cataloguing (and more) implies that a common core metadata scheme should be used for interoperability ? possibly with extensions for particular domains where interoperability is not required;
2. Metadata collection is expensive so incremental collection along the workflow is required: workflow systems should be evolved to accomplish this and scientific methods and data management working practices should be formalised using such workflows to reduce chores and risks of error as well as to gather the metadata required for curation;
3. Automated metadata extraction from digital objects shows promise but production system readiness is some years away.  However, metadata provision from equipment-generated streamed data is available;
4. ENVRIplus should adopt the DCC recommendations;
5. ENVRIplus should track the relevant RDA groups and ? ideally ? participate;


USE CASES AND REQUIREMENTS

All the requirements obtained from the interviews and the use cases indicated some awareness of the need for digital curation.  However, few RIs had advanced towards providing systems to achieve curation and even those that had advanced had not a full data management plan (including business case) in place.
The Curation requirements validate the need for ENVRIplus developing curation solutions but do not converge on particular requirements. This brief analysis is based on the information supplied by seven RIs who responded to this topic; see the wiki page for details11. In the planned work of ENVRIplus this work is already conceptually and practically interrelated with Cataloguing and Provenance in WP8. As remarked above, it should also strongly couple with the work on Data Identification and Citation. Consequently, many of the issues that emerge are similar to those identified above. However, some further issues arise. These are enumerated below:
1. The appreciation of the needs for Curation is varied and often limited, one manifestation of this is the almost universal absence of complete data management plans12. In practice a DMP evolves providing early the essentials for data collection and availability to the immediate community and later interoperability across the whole domain with enhanced metadata including not only descriptions of the data but also information on rights, security and privacy.  Consequently, this topic again poses a requirement for an ENVRIplus programme of awareness raising and training. If that is conducted collaboratively then it will also help develop cross-disciplinary alliances that will benefit scientific outcomes, management decisions and long-term cost-benefit trade-offs.
2. The need for intellectual as well as ICT interworking between these closely related topics: Identification and Citation, Curation, Cataloguing and Provenance is already recognised. Their integration will need to be well supported by tools, services and processing workflows, used to accomplish the scientific methods and the Curation procedures. However, there was negligible awareness of the need to preserve software and the contextual information necessary to re-run it with identical effects. The need for this combination for reproducibility is identified by Belhajjame et al. with implementations automatically capturing the context and synthesising virtual environments [Belhajjame 2015].
3. As above, it is vital to support the day-to-day working practices and the innovation steps that occur in the context of Curation with appropriate automation and tools. This is critical both to make good use of the time and effort of those performing Curation, and to support innovators introducing new scientific methods with consequential Curation needs.
4. The challenge of handling all forms of data described in ‘Problems to be overcome’ for Identification and Citation is compounded with the need to properly capture diverse forms of software (or, better, formal specifications of the software) and a wide variety of, often distributed, computational contexts in order to fully support reproducibility.
5. Curation needs to address preservation and sustainability; carefully preserving key information to underwrite the quality and reproducibility of science requires that the information remains accessible for a sufficient time. This is not just the technical challenge of ensuring that the bits remain stored, interpretable and accessible. It is also the socio-political challenge of ensuring longevity of the information as communities’ and funders’ priorities vary. This is a significant step beyond archiving, which is addressed in EUDAT with the B2SAFE service13.
6. One aspect of the approach to sustainable archiving is to form federations with others undertaking data curation, as suggested by OAIS14. Federation arrangements are also usually necessary in order that the many curated sources of data environmental scientists need to use are made conveniently accessible. Such data-intensive federations (DIF) underpin many forms of multi-disciplinary collaboration and supporting them well is a key step in achieving success. As each independently run data source may have its own priorities and usage policies, often imposed and modified by its funders, it is essential to set up and sustain an appropriate DIF for each community of users. Many of the RIs deliver such federations, today without a common framework to help them, and many of the ENVRIplus partners are members of multiple federations.


ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR CURATION

Introduction

We start with the state of the art and the requirements.  These indicate:
1. Technologies are available for curation but they may not be compatible with those for cataloguing and provenance;
2. Governance principles for curation are lacking widely among the ENVRI community;
3. Most RIs in the ENVRI community appreciate the importance of curation but are not practising it ? partly because existing used metadata standards do not support it explicitly and/or can only be made to support it partially;
On the other hand, there are examples of successful curation activity in other communities such as those that support life-sciences reference data, e.g., PDB [Berman 2008] and those that support sky surveys [Szalay 2008].
A major problem in ENVRIplus is the heterogeneity of the RIs in both governance and technology.  This may hinder take-up of any recommended curation solution.  On the other hand, some of the RIs already form informal clusters (usually by environmental domain) so there may be scope for collaborative work on curation with consequent increased benefit for the cost.
4. 

GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES FOR CURATION

Introduction
Since there is (relative to the volumes of data) little curation activity in ENVRIplus RIs at present (as recorded in D5.1) we can make recommendations expecting that there will be few problems integrating with existing governance and practices.
The key recommendation is that RIs should have a DMP, and ideally use the DCC documentation.  This ensures:
1. The RIs are actually thinking about the issue;
2. They generate governance recommendations relevant to their community and the assets of data, software and processing environments;
3. They adopt an appropriate metadata standard for cataloguing, curation and provenance or ? in the event of multiple established heterogeneous metadata formats ? they choose a canonical format and provide convertors;
4. Where appropriate RIs within an environmental domain cluster so as to share the cost (and benefit from experience) of curation.


INITIAL DESIGN

Introduction
The initial design is based not just on the state of the art and requirements for curation, but also for cataloguing and provenance (and also identification, citation and processing) for the reasons outlined above.  The design consists of two components: the catalog metadata and the curation processes.
Catalog Metadata
The catalog - for the purposes of curation ? needs to describe the asset to be curated with rich metadata.  The metadata must provide sufficient information for asset discovery, contextualization (for relevance and quality) and action. This is analogous to ? but goes beyond in the area of action -  the FAIR principles15. In the case of curation, the action is to ensure an asset can be (a) made available when required; (b) is understandable to human and computer systems.  The use of a logic representation provides advantages in deduction (facts from rules) and induction (rules from facts) which reduces potentially the metadata input burden and increases the validity of the metadata.  Furthermore, because of versioning and the relationship to provenance the metadata must include temporal information. 
This system design aspect therefore depends on T8.2 and its deliverable, D8.3.
However, the required metadata elements can be specified, derived from D5.1 and the work of the Metadata Interest Group (and its sub-groups) of RDA16 (see above under ‘State of the Art’.  The base entities (objects) typically required (but note these may be complex with internal structure (syntax) and semantics) are:
Research Product (i.e. asset), Person, Organisation, Project, Research Publication, Citation, Facility, Equipment, Service, Geographic bounding box, Country, Postal address, Electronic address, Language, Currency, Indicator, Measurement, Funding
and these entities need to be linked by linking entities to provide the role relationship (semantics) between base entities and the temporal duration of the truth of the assertion (the role linking the base entities).  The linking entities can refer to instances within the same base entity (e.g. Research Product related to Research Product: with role ‘derived’ or Research Product related to Organisation: with role ‘rightsholder’).
This structure gives great flexibility: the role relationships between Research Product and Person could be creator, reviewer, user�; those between Research Product and Facility, Equipment and service record the digital collection of the asset (Research Product).  Indicators and measurement relate to quality when linked to Research Product.  The address information may be linked to organization (such as the one owning the facility), the facility itself, the person or the organization employing the person (for the purpose of research).
The metadata structure outlined above could be encoded in RDF (as in the CKAN metadata of EUDAT B2FIND/B2SAVE) and ? using RDF ? could be made compatible with the W3C PROV-O standard for provenance (so linking curation and provenance).  Alternatively, the above conceptual structure could be encoded in CERIF (Common European Research Information Format; a EU recommendation to Member States)17 which is used widely for research information management but also for the EPOS project where it forms the catalog.  CERIF has been mapped to DC (Dublin Core), DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary), CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network which has is own metadata format based on DC) and ISO19115/INSPIRE (a EU directive).  The initial mapping to/from PROV-O18 has been done in joint work between euroCRIS and CSIRO, Canberra. CERIF provides a ‘switchboard’ for interoperability as a superset model compared with the others, capable of representing a fully connected graph and having declared semantics with crosswalk capability.
However, the existing metadata standards used within the RIs do not reach this level of richness of representation.  Convertors can be provided, but it is certain that RIs will need to provide additional information, supplementing that in their existing metadata, to achieve appropriate curation (and for that matter, provenance and cataloguing) especially for interoperation purposes.
D8.3 from T8.2 proposes that ENVRIplus recommends CKAN and CERIF as the canonical metadata standard and implements them within any prototype.  

Curation Processes
The processes associated with curation are:
1. Store an asset (e.g. dataset) with metadata sufficient for curation purposes;
2. Discover an asset using the metadata ? the richer the metadata and the more elaborate the query the greater the precision in discovering the required asset(s);
3. Copy an asset with its updated metadata (to have a distributed backup version);
4. Copy an asset with its updated metadata (media migration to ensure availability)
5. Move an asset with its updated metadata (to a distributed location if the original location is unable to manage curation);
6. Partition an asset and copy/move across distributed locations with its updated metadata (for privacy and security);
7. Partition an asset and copy/move across distributed locations with its updated metadata (for performance including locality of e.g. data with software and processing power)
All these processes could be applied to a set of assets as well as a single asset.  These processes are all simple given rich metadata in the catalog as outlined above.

CONCLUSIONS
The initial design of the curation functionality aims to maximize flexibility while retaining compatibility with the other tasks in WP8, namely provenance and the catalog.  The catalog is central to the design and the choice of the metadata elements in the catalog (including their syntax and semantics) is crucial for the processes not only of curation but also of provenance and catalog management and utilisation.  The metadata model of the catalog has also to permit interoperation among RIs as well as the usual processes associated with metadata catalogs: discovery, contextualisation and action.  This implies that the model must be a superset (in representation of syntax and semantics) of the metadata models used or planned within the RIs.
D8.3 from T8.2 proposes the use of CKAN (as used in EUDAT) and CERIF for the metadata catalog.  However, before proceeding to detailed design and prototype implementation it is necessary to validate both CKAN and CERIF against the requirements of provenance (which task does not start until later in the project) and the catalog.


IMPACT ON THE PROJECT

This deliverable relates closely to other tasks and deliverables, first within WP8 (cataloguing and curation) but also WP6 (Identification and citation) and WP7 (processing) leading towards representation in the reference model and the overall architecture design (WP5) and evaluation (WP9).
The choice of metadata standard for the catalog is a critical decision for the project.
It is expected that this deliverable will cause RIs to increase their attention to ? and effort on ? curation.  The result of positive action will be archives of curated environmental data essential for later research especially comparing the state of the environmental domain at that (future) time with now and past states as recorded.

IMPACT ON STAKEHOLDERS
The correct choice of catalog metadata standard has a huge influence on stakeholders since it conditions what processing facilities are available to all RIs in ENVRIplus.  The metadata has to support not only curation and provenance but also the usual research processes of discovery, contextualization (which may involve visualisation) and action which utilize the catalog to access and utilize the digital assets of the RIs and ? more importantly perhaps ? to interoperate across the RIs to allow novel interdisciplinary research. 
This deliverable should cause RIs to re-assess their strategy for curation and increase attention and effort on it, not only for the benefit of their community now and in the future but also for other communities interoperating with their own to achieve cross-domain research results.

 organisations or persons (e.g. rightsholder) 
5. for all the above is it possible to see the positioning and relationships of the object within a network of information such as previous and subsequent versions, related datasets or software to a given dataset, related organisation or person to a given object.....
 (this is where curation meets provenance).
And finally:
6. is a current and acceptable (sustainable) DMP (data management plan) in place

12 These may be latent in policy and management documents of each RI. Drawing them together into a formal DMP will take time. It might benefit from being collaborative, and from training such as that offered by the DCC, http://www.dcc.ac.uk/.
